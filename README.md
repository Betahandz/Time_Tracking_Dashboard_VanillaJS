## Overview

This is basically a project that focuses on your layout skills. Time tracking dashboard, this project is actually
for me to warm up, since it has been a while I wrote some Frontend Code. Made my only little changes to the data for
the project, which I will elaborate more on the **My Process** section.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

- Wrote a function that changes the hours for each of the property of the timeframe object.
- Added the hovering effect
- Media query for screen sizes of **720px and 1200px**
